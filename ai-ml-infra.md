# AI + ML Infrastructure Layers

## OpenAI
Began with this concept, but quickly started closing off access to results, to minimize public surprise and future shock.
Unclear if this worked, or if it successfully kept shock-materials from being incorporated and weaponized by the most exploitative adversaries.

## AI Infrastructure Alliances
The [AI Infrastructure Alliance](https://ai-infrastructure.org/), founded in 2020:

1) Establish a canonical stack for AI + ML operations 
2) Develop practices + architectures for AI/ML at scale 
3) Open algorithms, tooling, libraries, frameworks, models & datasets 
4) Design for privacy + anonymization. (e.g., w/ differential privacy, homomorphic encryption)
5) Develop standards to share data between AI/ML applications
