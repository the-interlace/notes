# About this notes repository

All interlays start as an idea:   
Someone realizes that there are enough moving parts in a system that a simple linked network is not enough, and can get disconnected or tangled.  
So a connective tissue is formed, with its own texture, resilience, and equilibrium, and bulk properties that individual connections can anchor to or draw on.

This is an initial collection of interlay descriptions and discussions, each of which may develop its own repository of code, data, and media.   
Once we reach 100 or so, we may migrate this to a wiki with better templating + transclusion + Wikidata integration.
