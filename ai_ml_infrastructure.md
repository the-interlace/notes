# AI + ML Infrastructure Layers

## OpenAI
OpenAI had a dream of contributing to an open infra layer early on, but later has been more closed, to minimize public surprise and future shock.
It is unclear if this approach succeeded in helping society // if it successfully kept shock-materials from being incorporated and weaponized by the most exploitative adversaries.

## AI Infrastructure Alliances
The [AI Infrastructure Alliance](https://ai-infrastructure.org/), founded in 2020:

1) Establish a canonical stack for AI + ML operations 
2) Develop practices + architectures for AI/ML at scale 
3) Open algorithms, tooling, libraries, frameworks, models & datasets 
4) Design for privacy + anonymization. (e.g., w/ differential privacy, homomorphic encryption)
5) Develop standards to share data between AI/ML applications
